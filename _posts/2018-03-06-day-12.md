## Reading Journal Debrief
With two people sitting next to you, debrief on the reading journal.  Were there parts that you were confused by?  If so, work as a group towards a better understanding.  The NINJAs will be available to help.

## Inheritance and Shapes
We have created a [Jupyter notebook](/notes/Geometry and Inheritance) that walks you through refactoring a set of classes using inheritance.
